## Hello Jekyll World (This is my fist post)

I made this blog to write about things I like, do and should remember. I will post stuff about Linux (Arch), Lua, PHP, AWK and some other stuff I should probably find on the web or books.

After testing a lot of Jekyll themes and watching some source code on github, I decided to create my own Jekyll theme (aka [taken](https://github.com/vfalanis/taken) ). 

There are lots of features missing in my theme but I will try to update it frequently.

Hope you find something useful!
